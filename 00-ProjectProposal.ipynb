    "Transportation is a major contributor to air pollution worldwide, particularly in urban areas where vehicle density and traffic congestion are highest. Emissions from cars, trucks, and other private vehicles like particulate matter, PMO, nitrogen dioxide, NO2,  carbon monoxide, CO, etc. have been linked to lung disease from the decrease in air quality they cause. Cars are one of the largest contributors to poor air quality, making transportation a critical focus of air pollution mitigation. Public transportation has been a counter to private transportation like cars for decades and we want to investigate the relationship between public transportation and air quality in comparison to private transportation’s footprint and we want to use air quality indices and lung disease rates to make our analysis of the relationship.\n",

    "Reference 1: https://www.uitp.org/news/why-public-transport-is-vital-in-achieving-clean-air-for-blue-skies/\n",
    "\tOne relevant prior work is the article “Why Public Transport is Vital in Achieving Clean Air for Blue Skies”, published by the International Association of Public Transport (UITP). This article highlights how expanding public transportation reduces urban air pollution, improving public health. The article draws from the WHO and the United Nations Statistics Division to show that 99% of people breathe unsafe air, contributing to premature deaths. This article relates closely to our proposed project because it explores a connection between air quality and health, as well as the impact of public transportation on both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reference 2: https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/62326\n",
    "Another relevant prior work is the technical report \"Assessing the Impact of Air Pollution on Public Health along Transit Routes”, which examines how transportation and socioeconomic factors influence respiratory health in some major metropolitan areas, Dallas-Fort Worth and LA. The researchers applied stat techniques such as PCA and OLS to identify predictors of respiratory disease. Their findings showed strong correlations between both demographics and access to transit/automobile access to respiratory disease risk. Interestingly, populations with higher transit access were more prone to respiratory diseases. This work relates closely to our proposed project because it demonstrates a clear connection between transportation systems, air quality, and respiratory health. \n"

    "We hypothesized that overall, the more public trasnportation and EVs usage as well as the decrease of smoking population and number of factories should collectively contribute to the improvement of air quality and the hence the decrease of asthma attacks. When comparing the factors and how influential each can be, we hypothesized that the number of factories can be the most influential on how the air quality is, and asthma attacks will also increase as more people living in the area and working in the area will be affected."

    "1. Explain what the **ideal** dataset you would want to answer this question.\\\n",
    "  The ideal dataset we would like to have is a combination of all of all factors being clearly documented for a span of 20 - 30 years. Either by months or by quarters can be even better as that gives us more data to use. For each individual factor, hopefully the numbers are accounted for approximately the same area, say included the whole metropolitan to fairly account for each trend. Idealy we can obtain the information for each city, and we can merge the information back to five individual dataframes where each factors have a valid number for each months or each year.\n",
    "2. What variables would you have?\\\n",
    "  The number of reported asthma attacks and air quality will be the main comparison factors among each group; and the public transportation ridership rate, the percentage of people who smoke, the number of factories in the center or suburban area, and the percentage of EVs on the market will be the four other factors we are looking at.\n",
    "3. How would they be stored?\\\n",
    "  We will have five separate data frames, and each column will be the data of individual years, ideally 10-30 years of data if we can obtain. Each row will then store the data, including the number of asthma attacks, air quality, the rate of public transportation ridership, the population of tobacco use, the percentage of EV cars in the market, and the number of factories in the area.\n",
    "4. How many observations would you have?\\\n",
    "  First of all, we can have an initial analysis on how air quality correlates with asthma attacks. Then we can draw five diagrams of how each factor correlates to air quality and then another five to asthma attacks. We can see which of these factors affect the two indexes the most. Lastly, we can do a test seeing whether the positive factors can cancel out the negative effects from the negative factors.\n",
    "5. What/who would the observations be? Over what time period? etc.\\\n",
    "  The observation should hopefully be a rise of public transportation and EVs leading to less people having asthma attacks, or the increased number of factories and tobacco use are actually making more people sick. The time span should at least be across the construction of public transportation or not, or an increase in the usage of public transportation, ideally 10-20 years to see a more significant change in rate.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project relies on aggregated, city-level secondary data (e.g., transportation usage, smoking rates, EV adoption, air quality metrics) rather than individual-level human subject data. Because we are not directly collecting data from individuals, informed consent is not applicable in the traditional sense. However, we acknowledge that the original data sources may have their own consent limitations, and we rely only on publicly available or ethically collected datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are several sources of potential collection bias in this dataset. Large cities differ significantly in transportation budgets, population density, and infrastructure, which affects public transportation usage, EV adoption, and driving behavior. Denser cities may naturally rely less on private vehicles, while smoking rates may be influenced by density-related stressors or local social norms. Income-related bias is also present, as wealthier populations are more likely to own EVs and rely less on public transportation, while lower-income groups may experience higher stressors, higher smoking rates, and greater exposure to pollution. Cultural and regulatory differences (such as smoking bans or EV incentives) further bias how data is collected and reported across cities.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While individual protected attributes such as race or gender are not directly included, we acknowledge that variables like income, age, transportation access, and neighborhood-level pollution can act as proxies for protected groups. We explicitly consider these limitations and design the analysis to test outcomes across income levels and city characteristics to help identify potential downstream bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All datasets are stored locally or in secure cloud-based academic environments with restricted access. Because the data is aggregated and non-PII, security risks are limited, but standard access controls and version management are still used.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data will be retained only for the duration of the project and any required academic review period. Afterward, datasets and derived files can be deleted or archived in anonymized form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We recognize that quantitative city-level data may miss lived experiences of communities most affected by asthma and lung disease, particularly lower-income populations. To reduce this blind spot, we explicitly question assumptions in the analysis and acknowledge that statistical relationships may not fully capture structural or social factors influencing health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We examine the dataset for imbalances, missing data, and uneven representation across cities and income groups. Confounding variables such as population density, transportation budgets, walkability, factory presence, median income, car ownership rates, smoking regulations, and EV incentives are explicitly considered to avoid overstating causal claims.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Visualizations and summary statistics are designed to reflect proportional differences across cities without exaggerating effects. We avoid specifically picking comparisons and clearly label axes, scales, and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The analysis process is documented step by step, including data sources, preprocessing decisions, and modeling assumptions, allowing results to be reproduced and reviewed if issues are identified later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We acknowledge that variables such as income, transportation access, and neighborhood pollution may act as proxies for protected characteristics. These variables are included carefully and interpreted cautiously to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or implying individual-level causation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Model outputs are compared across income levels and city characteristics to check for systematic differences that could indicate unfair or biased outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We consider multiple evaluation metrics rather than optimizing a single outcome, recognizing that focusing on one metric could obscure harms to certain groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The model and its results are kept interpretable, allowing us to explain in plain language how variables such as air quality, transportation patterns, and smoking rates relate to asthma outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We clearly communicate that correlations identified in the model do not imply causation and that remaining biases and confounders may still influence results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We acknowledge the risk that findings could be misused to oversimplify health disparities or place blame on certain populations. To mitigate this, we explicitly frame results as descriptive and exploratory and emphasize structural, environmental, and policy-related factors rather than individual behavior alone.\n"
