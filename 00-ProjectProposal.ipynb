When comparing the factors and how influential each can be, we hypothesized that the number of factories can be the most influential on how the air quality is, and asthma attacks will also increase as more people living in the area and working in the area will be affected."

    "1. Explain what the **ideal** dataset you would want to answer this question.\n",
    "1. What variables would you have?\\\n",
    "  The number of reported asthma attacks and air quality will be the main comparison factors among each group; and the public transportation ridership rate, the percentage of people who smoke, the number of factories in the center or suburban area, and the percentage of EVs on the market will be the four other factors we are looking at.\n",
    "2. How would they be stored?\\\n",
    "  We will have five separate data frames, and each column will be the data of individual years, ideally 10-30 years of data if we can obtain. Each row will then store the data, including the number of asthma attacks, air quality, the rate of public transportation ridership, the population of tobacco use, the percentage of EV cars in the market, and the number of factories in the area.\n",
    "3. How many observations would you have?\\\n",
    "  First of all, we can have an initial analysis on how air quality correlates with asthma attacks. Then we can draw five diagrams of how each factor correlates to air quality and then another five to asthma attacks. We can see which of these factors affect the two indexes the most. Lastly, we can do a test seeing whether the positive factors can cancel out the negative effects from the negative factors.\n",
    "4. What/who would the observations be? Over what time period? etc.\\\n",
    "  The observation should hopefully be a rise of public transportation and EVs leading to less people having asthma attacks, or the increased number of factories and tobacco use are actually making more people sick. The time span should at least be across the construction of public transportation or not, or an increase in the usage of public transportation, ideally 10-20 years to see a more significant change in rate.\n",
